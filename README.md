Project Overview
NASA Web Apps Orrery 2024 is a web-based simulation of the solar system that visualizes the movement of planets and celestial objects around the sun. The application uses interactive elements and animations to depict planetary orbits, rotational motion, and realistic cosmic effects like stars, star tails, and celestial bodies.

This project is ideal for anyone interested in astronomy, web development, and those looking to explore how the combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can create immersive and dynamic visualizations.

Features
Realistic Simulation: Displays the motion of planets in a highly accurate representation.
Interactive Audio: Users can play/pause background cosmic music for an enhanced experience.
Stylish Animations: Stars, star tails, planets, and other celestial bodies have custom animations.
SVG Filters: Custom visual effects like turbulence and color matrix filters applied to simulate stars and planetary structures.
Responsive Design: Adapts well to different screen sizes.
Live Demo
Check out the live demo of the project here. (Add link when available)

Technologies Used
HTML: Structure of the simulation.
CSS: For visual styles, animations, and filters.
JavaScript: For dynamic behavior and audio controls.
Setup and Installation
To get a local copy of this project up and running, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/azstar0619/nasa-webapps-orrery-2024.git
Navigate to the Project Directory:
